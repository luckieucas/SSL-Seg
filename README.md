## Semi-supervised Learning for Medical Image Segmentation (**SSL4MIS**)


# Usage


1. Train the 3d model
```
python train_semi-supervised.py --config train_config_3d.yaml
```
2. Train the 2d model
```
python train_semi-supervised.py --config train_config_2d.yaml
```
4. Test the model 
```
python test.py --model_path /path/to/trained_model
```
